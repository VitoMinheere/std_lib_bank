# Standard Library Bank

Welcome to the std lib bank! An application which will use every module from the Python 3.10 standard library.

## Description

I choose a banking app as that would already use most of the functionality as a GUI, file import and exports without adding a ton of useless features just to use a module. This project is made to learn what Python offers out of the box and how to use it all.


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

The GUI uses tkinter for which you might need to install it to display the UI
```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

### Installing

* How/where to download your program
* Any modifications needed to be made to files/folders

### Executing program

* How to run the program
* Step-by-step bullets
```
code blocks for commands
```
